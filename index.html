    <h2> Exploring SQL</h2>
    <p> For this project, I used PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4 to analyze the employees of a corporation. 
    <br> This project gave me the ability to practice my querying skills and become comfortable navigating 
    <br> through complex database through sub-queries and join statements. </p>
    <div> My queries can be found as this <a href="query.sql"> link </a> </div>
